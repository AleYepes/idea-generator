I'm looking to build a web app to help users validate product/design ideas using existing consumer data found online. The core functions will revolve around scraping relevant forums/sites for posts detailing first-person annoyances/inconveniences/problems/requests that the idea aims to solve. So, in a way, the web app is intended to measure the demand/frequency of the problem the idea is supposed to resolve.

## Basic functional flow:

1. User passes an input about an idea/problem they want to validate. For a very meta and recursive example, let's use my own idea: "I'm looking to build a web app to help users validate product/design ideas"

2. Script programmatically extracts keywords using some NLP model(s), maybe with a lib like spacy to start. In this case, the keywords might be "validate" and "ideas"

3. Nano LLM takes the raw string and maybe the extracted keywords as well and returns a list of forums/sites that will likely host relevant conversations to glean insights from.

4. Create targeted queries with the keywords and sites + helper phrases to tailor the search for user complaints/requests for help. Something like: site: reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur "is there" "validate" "ideas" or site:reddit.com/r/startups/ "how do" "validate" "ideas"

5. Pass targeted queries to Bing or other SEs and fetch all the URLS.

6. Have some other NLP model identify mentions of any annoyances/inconveniences/problems/requests in the fetched content. Tag:
- Painpoints
- 

7. Calculate aggregate statistics about the data and mentions
- num of search results processed
- num of mentions identified
- maybe even encode the mentions in embedding space to plot clusters, and present a more interactive plotty-like UI

8 Display the aggregate results client-side, alongside direct quotes for all the problem mentions + their corresponding URLs (This is still very half-baked and will likely change alot. My current vision focuses on the app data flow and data quality)



In some ways, this proposal resembles a more complex version of AnswerThePublic.com that digs into search result contents, rather than just the search engine autofills. I may end up using the autofills as well since they're also useful sources of data, plus autofills are a lot faster to query and include far less fluff/useless text to process.

In any case, before building all this, I'd like to run a mock test with you. You don't have to write any code, just help me go through the steps, analyzing my own idea with this little workflow. We can skip steps 7 and 8 since they're quite involved and instead focus on the data search and painpoint identification.
